## USB-C Hubs

* When connecting a USB-C hub to windows it reports an unknown device, and (Port
  Reset Failure) it may be due to the hub being powered. Disconnect the hub and
  uninstall the device driver (right-click the Windows menu and go to Device
  Manager). Then reconnect the hub without the power and Windows might now
  recognise it correctly, then you can reconnect the power.
